### Project Overview  
This project focuses on analysing electricity consumption data to
cluster customers into distinct groups using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Means
algorithm. By grouping customers based on similar usage characteristics, this project aims to uncover key
consumption patterns across different customer types.  These insights empower utility companies to develop tailored service
offerings, enhance resource utilization, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
